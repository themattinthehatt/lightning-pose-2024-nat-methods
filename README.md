# lightning-pose-2024-nat-methods
This repository provides code to rerproduce the figures in the manuscript [Biderman, Whiteway et al, 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538703v1).

## Dependencies
The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 22.04, using Python 3.10.
Required Python software packages are listed in [setup.py](https://github.com/themattinthehatt/lightning-pose-2024-nat-methods/blob/main/setup.py). 

## Installation with conda

First, ensure git is installed:
```shell
git --version
````
If git is not recognized, [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

We recommend using [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) to create a 
new environment in which this package and its dependencies will be installed:
```shell
conda create --name lpplots python=3.10
```

Activate the new environment:
```shell
conda activate lpplots
```
Make sure you are in the activated environment during the following steps.

Move into the directory where you want to place the repository folder, and then download it from GitHub:
```shell
cd <SOME_FOLDER>
git clone https://github.com/themattinthehatt/lightning-pose-2024-nat-methods.git
```

Then move into the newly-created repository folder:
```shell
cd lightning-pose-2024-nat-methods
```

and install the package and dependencies:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

The installation takes about 5 min on a standard desktop computer.

In a Python console, test if you can import functions:
```python
from lightning_pose_plots import utilities
```

## Download figshare data
You will need to select a folder where the data and results are stored, referred to as `data_dir`
in this and the following command line calls 
(replace `/path/to/data` with a real path on your machine).
The following command will download the labeled data and the results dataframes, which are together
approximately 12GB.
This will take 10-20 minutes depending on your download speed.
```shell
python scripts/download_data.py --data_dir=/path/to/data
```

## Reproducing the figures
To automatically reproduce the main figures from the downloaded data, run
```console
python scripts/plot_figure.py --data_dir=/path/to/data --figure=all
```
This script will take approximately 40 minutes to run.
Plots will be saved in a folder named `figures` inside the specified `data_dir`.

Individual figures can be reproduced by specifiying a number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for the `figure`
argument:
```console
python scripts/plot_figure.py --data_dir=/path/to/data --figure=1
```

When reproducing individual figures, you may also specify a dataset for figures 3, 4 and 5:
```console
python scripts/plot_figure.py --data_dir=/path/to/data --figure=3 --dataset=mirror-fish
```

See `scripts/plot_figure.py` for more information on the command line arguments.
